## Updating the pip package

This is mostly for myself since I have to lookup these commands every time ;)

1. Update version number in setup.py
2. Run the following commands
```
rm -rf build
rm -rf dist
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m build
```
3. Check that there is a .tar.gz and .whl file in the dist folder
4. Upload the new version
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
twine upload dist/*
```
